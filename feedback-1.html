        <p>This should be split into two separate questions.</p>
        <p>What the resource has done is that she had created it as one questions and two answers
        need to be provided. I prefer to keep all questions to MCQ for now. So one question for answer.</p>
        <p>So this question needs to be do separate question â€“ one asking (a) as the question and the other asking (b).</p>
